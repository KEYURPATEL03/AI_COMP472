To run the entire code, user will need to download scikit-learn, numpy, nltk and gensim libraries. 

For part 1: -> User will need to have the goemotions.json file in the same folder as .ipynb file to run the code and extract the posts.

For part 2: -> Specifically, the scikit-learn and numpy will be used in this part, and will need to import the relevant packages to run the code.
            -> To check the performance of each classifiers, user can check the "performance.doc" file.
          
For part 3: -> Gensim, nltk, scikit-learn and numpy will be used.

We have shown the performance of each classifier in its section, rather than creating a separate section for the performance. This will make it easy for the user to see the model and then check its performance simultaneously.
